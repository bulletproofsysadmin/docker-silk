# docker-silk

BulletProofAdmin fork of redjack/docker-silk.

This build aims to do the following:

- Make getting running quickly ( perhaps in a crisis ) much easier using SiLK.
- Add an SSH service for getting into the SiLK container and running commands.
- Config abstraction for ease of SiLK configuration.
- Compose support for binding non-standard ports to the flow collector.
- Docker Volume support for persistent data and data import.
